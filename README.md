  Consider a simple game that works as follows: the game involves two players who can choose to
  either cooperate or defect. If both players cooperate, each receives a reward of 3 coins. If one
  player cooperates and the other one defects, the defector receives 5 coins, and the cooperator
  receives 0 coins. If both defect, then each receives 1 coin.
