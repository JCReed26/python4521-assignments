COP4521 Homework 2

Name:  James Reed               FSU login: jcr22e


1) (10 points). Let variable rate = 0.122. Write a print statement that prints
the rate in both the raw value and the (round down) integer
percentage format as the following using f-string:

rate = 0.122 (12%)

print(f"rate: {rate} | {rate.floor()}")

-1.5 incorrect fstring logic 

import math
rate = 0.122
print(f"rate: {rate} ({math.floor(rate * 100)}%)")


2) (10 points). What is the output of the following code segment:

a = [i * 2 for i in range(10)]
print(a[:-2:3])

[6, 12]

-1.5 for partially incorrect slice output

a[:-2] is all except the last 2 
the :3 is every 3rd element so 0, 3, 6 indexes which are 
[0, 6, 12] 

3) (10 points). Write a function that takes two arguments, a dictionary
dict and a keyword key, and returns True if key is in dict
and False otherwise.

def foo(container, key):
	return key in container



4) (20 points). Write a lambda function that has the same functionality as
the following function.

import math
def isPowerOfTwo(x):
    if 2**int(math.log2(x)) == x:
        return True
    else :
        return False

power_of_two = lambda x: True if 2**(math.log2(x)) == x

-3 for flawed lamdba logic

you forgot he else False part at the end of the lambda function

5) (20 points). Complete the body of the function to count the number
of power of 2 numbers in a list using functional programming tools.
The body should only contain one return statement.

def countPowerOfTwo(lst):
	return [x for x in lst if 2**int(math.log2(x)) == x]


-3 for using a list comprehension instead of functional tools and not returning a count

def countPowerOfTwo(lst):
	return len(list(filter(lambda x: 2**int(math.log2(x))  == x, lst)))


6) (20 points). Write a class foo with three instance variables var1, var2,
and var3. var1 should be initialized to 10 and var2 to 20 when an object
of the class is created. var3 is initialized (to 30) when method aaa in the
class is invoked. 

class foo:
	def __init__(self):
		self.var1 = 10
		self.var2 = 20
		self.var3 = None

	def aaa(self):
		self.var3 = 30


7) (10 points). Write a class boo that is a derived class of foo in problem 6)
with an additional instance variable var that should be initialized to 100
when an object of class boo is created. 

class boo(foo):
	def __init__():
		super.__init__()
		self.var = 100

-1.5 for syntax errors in the derived class __init__(missing 'self' and incorrect 'super()' call)

class boo(foo):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		self.var = 100

	# hint you forgot the () on the super
