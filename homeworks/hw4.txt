1) (10 points) Explain network protocol and service interface.

    - A network protocol governs how two entities or different machines interact. 
    - A service interface is interactions with a service on the same machine. 
        This is to help abstract and avoid any complexity by utilizing layering.


2) (20 points) List four types of network services. Give all possible
types of services that can result in the following scenario: the
sender sends 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the receiver receives 1, 2, 3. 

    - Reliable connection-oriented, Reliable connentionless, Unreliable connection-oriented, Unreliable connentionless
    - Unreliable connection-oriented and Unreliable connentionless since both allow for packet loss that can also show up
        in the wrong order.


3) (10 points) List the seven layers in the ISO/OSI reference model, and
briefly describe the main functionality in each layer.

    - Physical layer: transfers bits over physical link
    - Data link layer: transfers frames between directly connected entities 
    - Network layer: routes packets to a possibly disconnected destination
    - Transport layer: achieves end to end communication
    - Session layer: allows for users to have personalized experiences
    - Presentation layer: general solutions for users
    - Application layer: variety of commonly used protocols


4) (10 points) List the four layers in the TCP/IP reference model, and
briefly describe the main functionality in each layer.

    - Application layer (ssh, DNS, HTTP, FTP) - the client through the socket
    - Transport layer (TCP, UDP) - for sending data packets across the network reliably and unreliably
    - Internet layer(IP) - network address utilizing the internet protocol
    - Host to network - data link through wire like an ethernet 


5) (20 points)  A computer is connected to a network using a 100Mbps
Ethernet link. An Ethernet frame includes all headers. The header sizes are:

  - Ethernet header: 14 bytes
  - IP header: 20 bytes
  - TCP header: 20 bytes

Assuming the computer continuously sends 500-bytes frames, and there are
no retransmissions or losses, what is the maximum end-to-end throughput
(in Mbps) that the computer can achieve at the application layer?

    - frame - headers / frame_size * link_bandwidth
    - 500 - 54 = 446/500=0.892x100,000,000=89,200,00
    = 89.2Mbps


6) (10 points) Ashley was excited to get the 1Gbps Internet service.
She performed an Internet speed test for the downlink on her PS5,
which indicated that for the speed test, 500MB data was sent. When the
test was done, it was reported that the downlink speed was 200Mbps.
How much time did it take to perform the speed test?

    - 500MB * 8bits/byte = 4000bits / 200bits/second 
    = 20 seconds


7) (10 points) Michael just upgraded to a new Internet Service Provider that
provides 100Gbps bandwidth from his old 10Gbps Internet access. Based only on
this information, will ALL network applications run better with this new
Internet Service Provider? Briefly justify your answer. 

    - No not all network applications run better with the new provider. This is due to 
    network latency and propagation delay which overall will keep the network slow and 
    limited to the speed of the slowest link.


8) (10 points) Describe the control flow of major socket function calls
in a sequential server program and in a network client program.

    - In a network client program, the network client is an active socket that initiates 
    connection to a server. This is done through creating a socket, connecting, send/recv,
    and closing the socket.
    - In a sequential server program, uses a passive socket that waits for and accepts 
    connections, but only one at a time. This is done by creating a socket object binding it 
    to a specific address and port like a phone number, then listen to make the socket 
    ready for connections and this will loop forever until a connection is accepted where 
    the accepted active socket will send/recv and close when the connection closes or a 
    new connection is accepted.
