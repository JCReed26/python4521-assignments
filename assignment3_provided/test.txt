A program receives at most 6 points if it generates a runtime error.
• Include the basic header (template available on the course website) for the assignment.
Name your program lastname_firstinitial_assignment3.py. Report the timing and
speedup (compared to the sequential version) of your program using 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16
processes. (10 points)
• Your parallel implementation must produce the same output for a 10x10 grid and 20
iterations using 2 processes. (10 points)
• Your parallel implementation must produce the same output for a 10x10 grid and 20
iterations using 4 processes. (10 points)
• Your parallel implementation must produce the same output for a 1024x1024 grid and
20 iterations using 2 processes, and the program must achieve a 20% speedup
compared to the sequential program. (10 points)
• Your parallel implementation must produce the same output for a 1024x1024 grid and
20 iterations using 4 processes, and the program must achieve a 20% speedup
compared to the sequential program. (10 points)
• Your parallel implementation must produce the same output for a 1024x1024 grid and
20 iterations using any number of processes (nprocs ≤ grid_size or ≤ 16), and the
program must achieve a 4× speedup compared to the sequential program. (10 points)
• Your program will be tested on another grid size. 20 points will be deducted if the code
passes the 10x10 and 1024x1024 grid tests but fails this test.
• 8 extra points for a program that earns all 60 regular points, with each process using
only O(grid_size × grid_size / nprocs) memory.
• 8 extra points for an OpenMP implementation that works correctly for all grid sizes and
achieves at least a 4× speedup for some grid size. To receive the extra points, you must
also specify how the speedup was achieved (compared to either a sequential C version
or your OpenMP code using 1 thread).
• Extra points: The first person to report a bug in the sample program will receive 3 extra
points.
